## Fluid Mechanics
* Why could fluid be regarded as contiuum?

  In engineering problems, the unit volume we chosen is **small enough** for solving our problem, but this volume is **too large** for a molecule. 
  So there will be a large number of molecules in that volume. With so much molecules in the unit volume, the molecules don't act as individuals, 
  but act as a gruop. These groups have the same properites, so that we can treat them in the same way, in staed of study every molecules, 
  which will drive us crazy! By the way, if we select a unit volume is too small the **molecular variations** will affect the density.  
  If we regard the fluid is continuum, it means the fluid change smoothly in the space, so we can use differential calculus to analyze the fluid.
